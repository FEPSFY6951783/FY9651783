      Abstract
    </h3>
    <p id="Abstract1">
      This paper discusses the importance of stealth aircraft and how engineers developed ways to reduce the effectiveness of radar on surveillance 
      and combat aircraft, and what compromises engineers make to achieve them. The paper discusses how methods such as specialised shaping of the
      airframe to reflect radio waves away from their source, and the use of radar absorbent material reduce radar cross section. A central takeaway 
      is how reducing the radar cross section is essential to stealth.
    </p>
    <h3 id="Introduction">
      Introduction
      </h3>
      <p id="Intro1">
        Radio Detection and Ranging, otherwise known as radar, is a system that uses radio waves to detect and determine the position of an object.
        Although developed independently by numerous countries prior to WWII, the Second World War accelerated the necessity and development of radar
        technology to track aircraft [William L. Melvin and James A Scheer, 2013].
      </p>
      <p id="Intro2">
        It was during the Second World War that the first countermeasure to radar was introduced, chaff, [Alabaster, Clive, 2012]. Modern stealth
        aircraft apply advanced engineering principles to reduce their radar cross-section through specialised shaping, radar-absorbent materials, 
        and careful internal design.
      </p>
        <p id="Intro3">This essay explores the engineering principles behind stealth technology and the compromises required to minimize radar detection.

      </p>
      <h3 id="Radar And Detection">
        Radar And Detection
      </h3>
    <p id="Radar1">
      Radar systems work by transmitting radio waves to detect and track targets. When the radio waves reach a target, their reflections can be picked up by a receiver, and the returning waves are processed. Information about the target can then be calculated, such as their position, size and speed [William L. Melvin and James A Scheer, 2013]. 
    </p>
      <p id="Radar2">
          Radar systems present a challenge in a military setting as an enemy radar system can allow an early and more effective response. The importance of radar’s role in detection led to its first implemented countermeasure in 1943, chaff, which was developed by both Germany and the United Kingdom [Alabaster, Clive, 2012]. Although chaff isn’t an example of stealth technology, it demonstrates the first exploitation of radar’s nature as radio waves, a concept that would continue with the development of stealth aircraft. 
      </p>
      <p id="Radar3">
          After WWII the focus shifted from distracting radar to instead making aircraft that were harder to detect by radar. The U2 surveillance plane was intended to flight so high it was out of range of radar, however this method of stealth proved unsuccessful, as the U2 was detected by the USSR on its first reconnaissance flight. After this, the radar cross section of the plane was considered when designing stealth planes [Suhler, Paul A.; Allen, Ned.; 2009].
      </p>
      <p id="Radar4">
      The radar cross section of an object refers to the size that the object appears on radar. This depends on the amount of signal reflected back to the receiver and is a large factor in detection [Knott, Eugene F.; Shaeffer, John F.; Tuley, Michael T.; c2004]. Stealth aircraft in a modern-day context are designed to minimise their radar cross section. This is achieved through several methods. These include the external structure of the aircraft being designed to reflect incident radio waves away from their source [Knott, Eugene F.; Shaeffer, John F.; Tuley, Michael T.; c2004], radar absorbent material being either used in the construction of the aircraft or coated onto the surface of the aircraft, and the internal systems such as the engines and weapon bays being concealed [M.E. Sharpe, Inc., issuing body.; 2009].
