      Abstract
    </h3>
    <p>
      This paper discusses the importance of stealth aircraft and how engineers developed ways to reduce the effectiveness of radar on surveillance 
      and combat aircraft, and what compromises engineers make to achieve them. The paper discusses how methods such as specialised shaping of the
      airframe to reflect radio waves away from their source, and the use of radar absorbent material reduce radar cross section. A central takeaway 
      is how reducing the radar cross section is essential to stealth.

      Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
        Radio Detection and Ranging, otherwise known as radar, is a system that uses radio waves to detect and determine the position of an object.
        Although developed independently by numerous countries prior to WWII, the Second World War accelerated the necessity and development of radar
        technology to track aircraft [William L. Melvin and James A Scheer, 2013].
      </p>
      <p>
        It was during the Second World War that the first countermeasure to radar was introduced, chaff, [Alabaster, Clive, 2012]. Modern stealth
        aircraft apply advanced engineering principles to reduce their radar cross-section through specialised shaping, radar-absorbent materials, 
        and careful internal design.
      </p>
        <p>This essay explores the engineering principles behind stealth technology and the compromises required to minimize radar detection.
